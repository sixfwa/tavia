## Outcomes

- Worked on the backend, to develop the backend to allow users to register their email and password. This is still incomplete.
- I met with Antonio where we went over my TP1 report

## Meeting with Antonio

We went over my TP1 report and focused on the sections regarding the sprints and the companies that provide similar services to the web application that I am building.

### Advice that he gave

- mention the algorithms that I use in the application. Such as LDA and sentiment analysis model
- for the tweets of a user to not be displayed on the website, nut only the analysis generated.

## Deadline

By the end of February I need to have completed the first three sprints I had listed on the TP1 report.

### Sprint 1 (TP1 Report)

- Database will be created for users to save their login details and their Twitter tokens
- User will be able to create an account on the web application and can log in and out
- User can link a Twitter account to their profile on the web app

### Sprint 2 (TP1 Report)

- User will be able to query Twitter users and gather a Twitter user's Tweets and who they follow.
- From the data collected of a Twitter user, the user of the web application can then see what topics a user frequently talks about and consumes
